# LocPost

Censorship resistant location-based messages that empowers anyone to have a voice.

We use [GUN](https://gun.eco/) to create a distributed database which is stored amongst the network participants in their local storage inside the web browser.
Each participant will keep a copy of the database and GUN will take care of keeping them in sync.

By requesting access to your location and based on that, you will join a censorship-resistant context (location) to exchange messages.
